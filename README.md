## Team MGCD Dashboard Project - Health in Scotland

# Introduction
This repository showcases a dashboard app created using R studio and Shiny functionality to explore health data in Scotland.  The team created a dashboard which allowed the user to explore two main health overview topics - Life Expectancy and Life Satisfaction.
